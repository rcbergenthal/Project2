                    <p class="recordBlurb">Bob Pyle's Apples and Oranges is, overall, puzzleing. Who is this for? one may ask. No one knows, probably only pyle himself. However, "Gentle Creatures" and "I've Been Restored" are shockingly tender and almost religious thematically. Also, my dad used to sing those two songs to me when i was little.</p>
